## 🎯 What is VisionSaliency?

In the world of computer vision and AI, API costs can quickly escalate when processing high-resolution images. VisionSaliency solves this problem by **automatically identifying and extracting the most important regions** of your images before sending them to expensive APIs like OpenAI Vision, Google Cloud Vision, or custom ML models.

**The Problem:** Sending a 4K image to a vision API when only 15% of it contains relevant content wastes money and processing power.

**The Solution:** VisionSaliency uses Apple's state-of-the-art attention-based algorithms to:
- 🎯 **Detect attention-grabbing areas** with pixel-perfect accuracy
- ✂️ **Smart crop** to focus on relevant content 
- 📐 **Adaptive resize** based on content complexity
- 💰 **Reduce API costs** by up to 75% while maintaining quality

## 🚀 Key Features

### Intelligent Processing Pipeline
- **🔍 Attention Detection**: Utilizes Apple's `VNGenerateAttentionBasedSaliencyImageRequest` for cutting-edge saliency analysis
- **🧠 Smart Cropping**: Intensity-weighted centroid calculation with quantile-based boundary detection
- **⚙️ Adaptive Resolution**: Dynamic scaling (512px-768px) based on region of interest complexity
- **📊 Multi-Visualization**: View original, attention map, overlay, and optimized API-ready outputs

### Cost Optimization Technology
- **💡 Context-Aware Padding**: Dynamic padding based on object proximity to image borders
- **📏 Intelligent Sizing**: Smaller ROIs get lower resolution, complex scenes get higher resolution
- **🎨 Quality Preservation**: Maintains visual fidelity while dramatically reducing file sizes
- **⚡ Real-time Processing**: Asynchronous analysis with instant feedback

### Developer-Friendly Workflow

- **📱 Native iOS Integration**: Built with SwiftUI and Vision Framework
- **💾 Export Ready**: Save optimized images directly to Photos library
- **📈 Performance Metrics**: Real-time confidence scores and processing analytics

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Core Vision Framework Implementation
```swift
// State-of-the-art saliency detection
let request = VNGenerateAttentionBasedSaliencyImageRequest()
let handler = VNImageRequestHandler(cgImage: cgImage, options: [:])
try await handler.perform([request])
```

### Advanced Optimization Algorithms

#### Smart Cropping Logic
```swift
// Dynamic padding based on border proximity
let borderMin = min(rect.minX, rect.minY, imageWidth - rect.maxX, imageHeight - rect.maxY)
let closeness = max(0, min(1, borderMin / max(imageWidth, imageHeight)))
let paddingRatio = 0.02 + 0.08 * closeness
```

#### Adaptive Resolution Scaling
- **Small ROI** (< 15% of image): 512px target - Perfect for simple objects
- **Medium ROI** (15-35%): 640px target - Balanced for detailed scenes  
- **Large ROI** (> 35%): 768px target - Preserves complex compositions
